## Setting up the environment

The flutter dependency is dealt with by downloading and building the thirdparty project.
 
[Build thirdparty project](../../../thirdparty/blob/master/README.md)

Simply add `thidparty/build/PLATFORM/Release` to `PATH`. 

## Run on Linux

```bash
    flutter run
```
You're going to be prompted a run option. For example:

```bash

# üöÄ Sandbox Mode

The wallet supports **Sandbox Mode**, allowing it to run **without third-party dependencies**. This is useful for testing and development without requiring external services.


## üõ†Ô∏è Enabling Sandbox Mode

To enable **Sandbox Mode**, set `CMAKE_SKIP_THIRD_PARTY` to `ON` in the `CommonOverrideFlags.cmake` file:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_SKIP_THIRD_PARTY ON)
```

This ensures that third-party dependencies are skipped when building the wallet.


## üîë Passing a Wallet Private Key

You can provide a **wallet private key** during startup via **Flutter arguments** or a **launch file**.

### üìå **Option 1: Using Flutter Arguments**
Run the following command to start the wallet with an imported private key:
```sh
flutter run -d windows --dart-define=WALLET_PK=yourprivatekey
```

### üìå **Option 2: Using a Launch File**
To set the private key in a **launch file**, add the following configuration:

```json
"args": [
    "--dart-define=WALLET_PK=yourprivatekey"
],
```

This approach allows you to predefine the wallet key for easier debugging and testing.
