# Genius Wallet

A Cryptocurrency wallet app built with [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) and [Parabeac](https://parabeac.com/).

## Download Genius Wallet project

```bash
git clone git@github.com:GeniusVentures/GeniusWallet.git --recursive 
cd GeniusWallet
```

### Installing Flutter

The project requires Flutter version 3.32.5 or higher.

<details>
<summary><strong>Expanded Flutter installation instructions</strong></summary>

We provide installation scripts that will automatically install Flutter in the `../thirdparty/flutter` directory if needed.

#### Automatic Installation (Recommended)

**Linux/macOS:**

```bash
./install_flutter.sh
```

**Windows:**

```cmd
install_flutter.bat
```

The scripts will:

* Check if Flutter is already installed and its version
* Install Flutter 3.32.5+ if needed via the thirdparty Git submodule
* Provide instructions for PATH configuration

#### Manual Installation

If you prefer manual installation or the scripts don't work:

```bash
pushd ..
git clone git@github.com:GeniusVentures/thirdparty.git
cd thirdparty
git checkout main
git pull
git submodule update --init --recursive -- flutter
# Add to PATH - Linux/macOS:
export PATH="${PWD}/flutter/bin:${PATH}"
# Add to PATH - Windows:
# set PATH=%CD%\flutter\bin;%PATH%
popd
```

After installation, add `thirdparty/flutter/bin` to your PATH permanently.

### Building Dependencies

The project uses CMake to automatically download required dependencies (SuperGenius, GeniusSDK, zkLLVM, thirdparty) when building. These are downloaded based on your platform and build type.

For manual dependency management, see [Build thirdparty project](../../../thirdparty/blob/master/README.md).

<summary><strong>iOS and macOS Development Setup</strong></summary>

## iOS and macOS Development Setup

For iOS and macOS development, you'll need to install CocoaPods:

**Recommended: Install via RVM (Ruby Version Manager)**

Using RVM allows you to manage multiple Ruby versions for different projects:

```bash
# Install RVM if you don't have it
\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm

# Install Ruby 3.2.4 (or check your current version with: rvm list)
rvm install 3.2.4
rvm use 3.2.4 --default

# IMPORTANT: Install CocoaPods for this Ruby version
gem install cocoapods

# Verify CocoaPods is installed in the right place
which pod  # Should show: ~/.rvm/gems/ruby-3.2.4/bin/pod
pod --version
```

**Fixing OpenSSL Errors when Installing Ruby**

If you get `make[1]: *** [ext/openssl/all] Error 2` when installing Ruby:

```bash
# For Apple Silicon Macs (M1/M2/M3)
brew install openssl@3
rvm install 3.2.4 --with-openssl-dir=$(brew --prefix openssl@3)

# For Intel Macs
brew install openssl@1.1
rvm install 3.2.4 --with-openssl-dir=$(brew --prefix openssl@1.1)

# Alternative: Use rbenv instead of RVM
brew install rbenv ruby-build
rbenv install 3.2.4
rbenv global 3.2.4
```

**Common Issue: "pod: command not found" with RVM**

If you have RVM Ruby but `pod` isn't found:

```bash
# 1. Make sure you're using the right Ruby
rvm use 3.2.4
which ruby  # Should show: ~/.rvm/rubies/ruby-3.2.4/bin/ruby

# 2. Install CocoaPods for THIS Ruby version
gem install cocoapods

# 3. Rehash to update available commands
rvm gemset rehash

# 4. Verify installation
gem list cocoapods  # Should show cocoapods in the list
which pod           # Should show: ~/.rvm/gems/ruby-3.2.4/bin/pod
```

**Making Flutter use RVM's Ruby instead of System Ruby**

Flutter may default to macOS system Ruby. To fix this:

1. **Ensure RVM is loaded in your shell:**

   ```bash
   # Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc if not already there:
   source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm
   ```

2. **Check which Ruby Flutter is using:**

   ```bash
   # In your Flutter project directory
   which ruby        # Should show ~/.rvm/rubies/ruby-3.2.4/bin/ruby
   ruby --version    # Should show ruby 3.2.4
   which pod         # Should show ~/.rvm/gems/ruby-3.2.4/bin/pod
   ```

3. **If Flutter still uses system Ruby, create a wrapper script:**

   ```bash
   # Create a pod wrapper that ensures RVM Ruby is used
   sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/bin
   sudo tee /usr/local/bin/pod > /dev/null << 'EOF'
   #!/bin/bash
   source ~/.rvm/scripts/rvm
   rvm use 3.2.4
   exec ~/.rvm/gems/ruby-3.2.4/bin/pod "$@"
   EOF
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/pod
   ```

4. **Alternative: Set Ruby version for the project:**

   ```bash
   # In your Flutter project root
   echo "3.2.4" > .ruby-version

   # This tells RVM to automatically switch to 3.2.4 when entering the directory
   ```

5. **Verify the fix:**

   ```bash
   cd ios  # or macos
   pod --version     # Should work without Ruby warnings
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   cd ios && pod install  # Should use RVM's Ruby
   ```

**Troubleshooting Ruby Conflicts**

If you see errors like "You have already activated X, but your Gemfile requires Y":

```bash
# Clean up and reinstall
rvm use 3.2.4
gem uninstall cocoapods -a
gem install cocoapods
cd ios && rm -rf Pods Podfile.lock
pod install
```

**Note:** The macOS system Ruby is outdated and missing components. Always use RVM or rbenv for development.

You'll also need Xcode Command Line Tools:

```bash
xcode-select --install
```

**Setting up Xcode Developer Credentials**

If you see "Failed to load credentials" or "missing Xcode-Token" errors:

1. **Sign out and back in to Xcode:**

   ```
   Xcode ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Accounts
   - Select your Apple ID (dev@geniusventures.io)
   - Click the "-" button to remove it
   - Click "+" ‚Üí Apple ID ‚Üí Sign in again
   - Enter your Apple ID and password (or use 2FA if enabled)
   ```

2. **If that doesn't work, clear Xcode's credentials cache:**

   ```bash
   # Close Xcode first
   # Delete stored credentials
   security delete-generic-password -s "Xcode-Token"
   security delete-generic-password -s "Xcode-AlternateDSID"

   # Clear Xcode's derived data
   rm -rf ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData

   # Restart Xcode and sign in again
   ```

3. **For CI/CD or command line builds:**

   ```bash
   # Sign in via command line
   xcrun altool --list-apps --username "dev@geniusventures.io" --password "@keychain:AC_PASSWORD"

   # Or store credentials
   xcrun altool --store-password-in-keychain-item "AC_PASSWORD" -u "dev@geniusventures.io" -p "your-app-specific-password"
   ```

4. **Download certificates manually:**

   * Go to Xcode ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Accounts
   * Select your team
   * Click "Download Manual Profiles"

**Note:** If using 2FA, you may need to generate an app-specific password at [https://appleid.apple.com](https://appleid.apple.com)

# Use a specific branch for dependencies
CMAKE_ARGUMENTS="-DGENIUS_DEPENDENCY_BRANCH=master" flutter build <ostype>
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>üöÄ Sandbox Mode</strong></summary>

The wallet supports **Sandbox Mode**, allowing it to run **without third-party dependencies**. This is useful for testing and development without requiring external services.

### üõ†Ô∏è Enabling Sandbox Mode

To enable **Sandbox Mode**, set `CMAKE_SKIP_THIRD_PARTY` to `ON` in the `CommonOverrideFlags.cmake` file:

```cmake
set(CMAKE_SKIP_THIRD_PARTY ON)
```

This ensures that third-party dependencies are skipped when building the wallet.

### üîë Passing a Wallet Private Key

You can provide a **wallet private key** during startup via **Flutter arguments** or a **launch file**.

#### üìå Option 1: Using Flutter Arguments

```sh
flutter run -d windows --dart-define=WALLET_PK=yourprivatekey
```

#### üìå Option 2: Using a Launch File

To set the private key in a **launch file**, add the following configuration:

```json
"args": [
    "--dart-define=WALLET_PK=yourprivatekey"
],
```

This approach allows you to predefine the wallet key for easier debugging and testing.
