# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-07-15)

**Core value:** Users can safely custody their keys and reliably perform core wallet actions.
**Current focus:** Phase 2 — Design tokens & verification loop

## Current Position

Phase: 2 of 11 (Design tokens & verification loop)
Plan: 5 of 5 in current phase
Status: Ready to execute
Branch: `ui-redesign-port` (off develop) — `branching_strategy: none`, phases land here
Last activity: 2026-07-16 — Phase 2 complete (5/5 criteria, human-verified): token vocabulary on develop with zero visual change; hot-reload verification loop established; dev tools gated behind GW_DEV_TOOLS

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░] 9% (1 of 11 phases)

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Full log in PROJECT.md Key Decisions. Recent:

- **Port the design incrementally, layer by layer** (2026-07-16) — 128 of the design's 172 files collide with develop (74%); one step means reconciling all of them with nothing verifiable in between
- Sequence by dependency, not subject: tokens → `gw_*` primitives → nav shell → screen areas. Each phase lands on a layer that already exists and has been reviewed
- GAP treatment split: GAP-01 (inventory + decision) rides in Phase 3 because "extend the design language" is a design-system question that must be answered before screens land; GAP-02..06 ride in the phase that owns their surface
- Screen areas were **not** compressed despite `granularity: standard` — merging them recreates the reconcile-everything-at-once failure this milestone exists to avoid
- Keep `ui-redesign-3.514-develop` as read-only reference; port its 3 remaining fix commits with their components (BEH-02)
- Interactive mode (config is committed to the shared repo)
- [Phase 2]: google_fonts inserted next to go_router in pubspec.yaml (nearest alphabetical neighbor) rather than resorting the non-alphabetical dependency block
- [Phase 2]: gw_appearance.dart ported verbatim except the Hive import (hive_ce_flutter instead of classic hive_flutter), matching develop's data layer
- [Phase 2]: Ported f3fd16f's dev_flags.dart byte-for-byte, including its docstring, per UI-SPEC guidance.
- [Phase 2]: Only responsive_overlay.dart's Dev row is gated this phase; wallet_creation_screen.dart onboarding buttons deferred to Phase 6 (they don't exist on develop today).
- [Phase 02-design-tokens-verification-loop]: appBarHeight deferred to Phase 4: develop's 60 kept, design branch's 65 not ported (real visual change, still in live use by responsive_overlay.dart)
- [Phase 02-design-tokens-verification-loop]: genius_wallet_colors.dart and genius_wallet_gradient.dart ported as pure insertions (0 deletions); genius_wallet_consts.dart's 6 legacy aliases re-pointed after per-alias value verification
- [Phase 02-04]: All six remaining redesign theme files (motion, font-size, copy-text, elevation, typography, decorations) ported byte-identical, zero adaptation needed, zero collision — Grep-verified before planning that develop referenced none of these six class names anywhere in lib/ or packages/
- [Phase 02-04]: GWCanvasBackground ported as a dormant class, instantiated nowhere in lib/ — References assets/images/textures/noise.png, an asset owned by DS-04/Phase 3, not bundled this phase
- [Phase 02-04]: toMaterialTextTheme() ships but is not wired into theme.dart this phase — theme.dart is the 100%-collision file UI-SPEC section 1.1 excludes wholesale for the whole of Phase 2; wiring belongs to Phase 4's shell re-skin
- [Phase 02-design-tokens-verification-loop]: TokenProbeScreen wraps its body in ValueListenableBuilder on GWAppearance.instance so the appearance toggle actually rebuilds; setMode() alone persists but does not repaint
- [Phase 02-design-tokens-verification-loop]: 02-VERIFICATION.md marks criteria 1 and 3 OUTSTANDING and criterion 4 PARTIAL rather than PASS -- an unearned PASS is the exact BLD-02 failure mode (37 regressions shipped analyze-clean)
- [Phase 02-design-tokens-verification-loop]: Onboarding Mock button (ROADMAP criterion 4) recorded as an explicit Phase 6 deferral, not a pass -- it does not exist on develop today

### Pending Todos

- Phases 2–10 are UI phases (`ui_phase: true`, `ui_safety_gate: true`) — each should get a UI-SPEC design contract via `/gsd-ui-phase` before planning
- Corrected the v1 requirement count in REQUIREMENTS.md: 22 → 24 (previous count was wrong)

### Blockers/Concerns

- **No working automated test harness** (`flutter test` does not compile) — every success criterion in the roadmap is phrased to be observable by running the app. `flutter analyze` is a gate, never evidence. Fixing the harness is deferred to APP-02 (v2)
- Nav shell has never been visually walked — Phase 4 addresses this
- 37 evidenced defects in the design-vs-develop surface (`.planning/REVIEW_FINDINGS_REDESIGN.md`, 3 blockers) are assigned per phase; Phase 11 signs off the full set
- `analysis_options.yaml` excludes `lib/**/*.g.dart` — the compiler, not analyze, is the real gate for generated widgets
